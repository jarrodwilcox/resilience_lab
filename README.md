* authored by Jarrod Wilcox, March 22, 2020.
The file resilience04222021.pdf is a short slide presentation describing tools available in the Puthon and Jupyter notebook files in this repository.

## Features

1.	A toolset for investors seeking greater resilience against systemic risk stemming from non-traditional sources such as pandemics, revolutionary technology, climate change, and political upheavals is created, with an example based on the impact of poorly understood derivatives in the financial crisis of 2007-2009.

2.	Confronting the wave-like character of systemic disruptions with their time stages that may include a sudden shock, rolling disruption, or gradual recovery as winners and losers are revealed, led to a method of making single period allocations that reflects multiple time horizon outcomes while staying within a simple and easily implemented decision-theory framework.

3.	Other tools for resilient investing include top-down hierarchical cluster analysis, measures of tail risk customized by risk aversion, preserving more useful information by shrinking means but not covariances, and transparent open-source software.
